# Olympic Games
This project presents fullstack MEAN application which simulates organising and monitoring competitions within olympic games in Tokyo 2021.
Project is run by initialy establishing connection between database and backend (using command npm run serve, located in folder backend), then activating frontend (using command ng serve, located in folder frontend/app).
Beside guest users, there are three types of users: organizer, delegate and head of national delegation.
